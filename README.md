# 👩‍🎓 **About Me**

Hello! My name is **Williane Yarro**, and this repository is my official **AI Applications Portfolio** for Houston Community College.

This portfolio captures everything I learned in this course, from early Python exercises to full applied AI mini-projects. It demonstrates not only my technical growth, but also my ability to organize, document, and present professional AI-related work.

My long-term goal is to continue building AI skills that will support future academic, professional, and project opportunities.

# 📌 **Assignment Overview**

The **AI Applications Portfolio Assignment** required me to:

### ✔ Build a GitHub repository

Organized with all class modules, assignments, and AI mini-projects.

### ✔ Prepare a 5-slide employer-ready presentation

Summarizing my skills, highlights, and projects.

### ✔ Include course notes

To demonstrate concept understanding.

### ✔ Add resource links

Used throughout the semester.

### ✔ Add explanations for every module

So each assignment is clear and meaningful to employers or instructors.

This portfolio is both a **course requirement** and a **professional portfolio** I can continue to grow.
